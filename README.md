# I_AM_ROOT_patches
A set of patches for common unix programs to disable 'don't run me as root' checks. Laid out in a format to allow being cloned into portage/patches on Gentoo.  
Note: possibly bad idea. your own risk yadda yadda. you know what you're doing already, or you wouldn't be here :)  

I doubt any changes I make here are 'copyrightable', but if it makes you happy, any copyrightable additions I make here are dual licensed under both 0-clause-BSD + MIT. Go ham.
